## Review Changes

Perform a thorough, risk-aware code review using the knowledge graph.

### Steps

1. **Ensure the graph is current** by calling `build_or_update_graph_tool()` (incremental update).

2. Run `detect_changes` to get risk-scored change analysis.
3. Run `get_affected_flows` to find impacted execution paths.
4. For each high-risk function, run `query_graph` with pattern="tests_for" to check test coverage.
5. Run `get_impact_radius` to understand the blast radius.
6. For any untested changes, suggest specific test cases.

### Output Format

Provide findings grouped by risk level (high/medium/low) with:
- What changed and why it matters
- Test coverage status
- Suggested improvements
- Overall merge recommendation

## Token Efficiency Rules
- ALWAYS start with `get_minimal_context(task="<your task>")` before any other graph tool.
- Use `detail_level="minimal"` on all calls. Only escalate to "standard" when minimal is insufficient.
- Target: complete any review/debug/refactor task in ≤6 tool calls and ≤800 total output tokens.
